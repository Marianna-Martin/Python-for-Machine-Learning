## Definition
Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the algorithm learns from labeled data, which means it is provided with input-output pairs during training. In supervised learning, the algorithm tries to learn the mapping or relationship between input features and the corresponding output labels.

Here's how supervised learning works:

1. **Labeled Training Data**: 
   - You start with a dataset that consists of input features and their corresponding output labels. For example, if you're building a model to predict house prices, the input features might include the number of bedrooms, square footage, etc., and the output label would be the price of the house.

2. **Training the Model**:
   - You feed the labeled training data into the supervised learning algorithm.
   - The algorithm learns from the training data by finding patterns and relationships between the input features and output labels.
   - It adjusts its internal parameters or model structure to minimize the error between its predictions and the actual output labels in the training data.

3. **Model Evaluation**:
   - After training, you evaluate the performance of the model using a separate dataset called the validation or test set.
   - The model's predictions on the validation set are compared to the actual labels, and various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, or mean squared error are calculated to assess the model's performance.

4. **Making Predictions**:
   - Once the model is trained and evaluated, it can be used to make predictions on new, unseen data.
   - You provide the input features of the new data to the model, and it predicts the corresponding output labels based on what it learned during training.

Supervised learning is used in a wide range of applications, including:
- Email spam detection
- Sentiment analysis
- - Stock price prediction
- Medical diagnosis
- Image recognition
- Autonomous vehicles
